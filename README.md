# Atari ST "shifter" - verilog model (WIP)

This verilog model is an ongoing project to implement the Atari ST's shifter
ASIC in verilog, for the purposes of recreating it in an FPGA.

The goal of this project is HDMI-out for Atari STFM.

## Basic requirements:
- Icarus Verilog (`iverilog` in Ubuntu 16.04)
- GTKWave (`gtkwave` in Ubuntu 16.04)

## Usage:
1. Run the simulation with `make wave`
1. Load waveforms in GTKWave to view
